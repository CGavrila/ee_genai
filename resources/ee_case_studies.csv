0,Designing a technical solution to shift from time-intensive paperwork to automated productivity,"Designing a technical solution to shift from time-intensive paperwork to automated productivity Initially, Move 4 Life were looking to enhance and automate their key business processes. As part of their service delivery model, employees at corporate customers sign up for training courses, training staff are allocated the courses and sessions to run, participants fill out information sheets at the end of each session, and eventually, their course completion is documented as part of each company’s OH&S requirement. Historically, the team at Move 4 Life had managed these processes manually, using a range of common—though time and work intensive—tools like spreadsheets and paper documentation. Designing a technical solution to automate these processes created enormous value. Firstly, by developing a mobile application with Salesforce acting as the backend platform, Move 4 Life could easily and efficiently manage everything associated with training courses, corporate customers, and end users. With less time spent on admin, the team was free to focus on more valuable initiatives like connecting with prospective clients for new business opportunities. Secondly, there was a growing appetite for clients to include Move 4 Life programs as part of their formal training and re-training. By developing a mobile application, Move 4 Life could deliver ‘refresher courses’ through content delivery at key points after the initial in-person training sessions. This not only extends the breadth and depth of their engagement with corporate clients, but allows the team to create valuable content and training modules that can be accessed remotely, and delivered in perpetuity after having been designed and delivered once.​​In developing a mobile app to deliver course content remotely, Move 4 Life could offer far greater value, far more efficiently. For everyone involved. The application was delivered within three months, working in collaboration with a team of developers from around the world. Within the first month after initial launch, Move 4 Life had 6,000 customers sign up to complete coursework online.Flexible support: pivoting Move 4 Life to extend the application as a desktop version Just prior to launching the application, a last-minute request came through from one of the team’s major corporate clients. While the mobile app was a valuable tool in delivering refresher course content on-the-go, there was a realisation that many of the staff for this particular client work in an office setting. Ideally, the app would need to be extended as a web version, to facilitate a high-quality user experience on desktop devices. By building the app with Dart and Flutter managing the back- and front-end respectively, we were able to extend components of the application and flexibly reformat them for a desktop experience. This was able to be completed and delivered in conjunction with the initial three-month development period for the app, without any disruption to delivery.Beyond the development and delivery of an initial product suite, our partnership involves supporting Move 4 Life to mature as a digital-first organisation In addition to technical infrastructure support, our partnership is now expanding to include programs of user research, user experience design, prototyping, user testing, feature prioritisation, and a broad range of activities involved in maintaining digital products.","{""questions"": [""What are the benefits of the mobile app?"", ""What are the benefits of the desktop app?"", ""What are the benefits of the partnership?""]}"
1,Demonstrating the business value of a pivot towards mobile-first technology,"Demonstrating the business value of a pivot towards mobile-first technology A web-first approach met the initial goal of reaching new customers via the website and launching new propositions rapidly into multiple international markets, but it came with some well understood  trade-offs. It is typically not  the  preferred experience for frequent, on-the-go use; however, with speed-to-market, risk and cost reduction the priority, it was the pragmatic place to  begin, always ensuring the capability was ready to support additional digital channels later with an API-first approach. After launching the web version, real-world data insights clearly demonstrated the business case for further investment to extend the proposition to mobile apps, with the goals of improving the end-user experience and increasing reach, adoption and customer engagement. The end product would more tightly integrate customer propositions, as well as supporting Pret’s strategic goal of reaching more of its customers via digital through a presence in app stores.  Beginning with ‘Pret Pick Up’ the team set about pivoting the proposition to mobile-first. App development for iOS and Android platforms, with their sophisticated capabilities,  brings a level of additional complexity, with non-standard development languages, frameworks and specific design and platform requirements. However, the benefits when taking advantage of these capabilities transcend these factors. Studies show that retail customers have a strong  preference for apps over web when on mobile devices; in 2021 mobile as a share of total e-commerce spend was 72.9% (Source: Statista)  with users spending 7x more time in native apps and purchasing more frequently when using them.  (Source: App Annie) Having already built out the business proposition and the underlying APIs, the mobile app development team, together with Pret’s product team, could focus on the most important aspect of the transition from mobile web to mobile app. Providing a fully app-like experience to meet  customers expectations, resulting in both a positive customer experience and favourable reviews and comments in app stores. (The app is rated 4.9 stars: Source Apple App Store, Oct 2022) Whilst simultaneously working on a well-timed brand redesign, the design team set to work creating both iOS and Android apps, applying the specific idioms and design of each mobile OS. We balanced these needs to combine the various propositions that would lead to the creation of a fully integrated, consistent, standalone app-like experience that maintained the simplicity of the Pret brand. The decision to pivot towards mobile-first was  well timed. Adoption was phenomenal, with 85% of all Pret Pick Up orders being made through the app within a matter of weeks. In fact, across the industry mobile ordering of fast food and food delivery was surging  with 110% year on year growth in 2020, demonstrating that this was a vital development  for Pret (Source: App Annie)How Fast Follow native app development reduces cost and speeds up production Although it is possible to build simultaneously for multiple mobile  platforms in the early stages of creating  a proposition, it does create additional overhead. Multiple teams, working on multiple platforms simultaneously – where the requirements are yet to be defined – carries an inherent cost. To mitigate this overhead, we recommend the ‘fast follower’ pattern. Fast Follow development means leading with customer’s primary mobile OS  to begin with, then following quickly with the second after the early ‘discovery’ stages of development have completed. This discovery period is when the risk of rework is at its highest and where a smaller team can move faster. The impact of inevitable rework (as new learnings are uncovered)  is therefore minimised. In Pret’s case there was an obvious preferred mobile OS and it was viable to lead on this before introducing a second (an insight gained from usage of the web version). Given a strong launch and positive market response,  bringing the experience to all customers was a clear opportunity. However, as it would serve a smaller percentage of customers  any efficiencies would improve the business case. This hypothesis held up, and by taking this approach  the app development for Android (the second mobile OS) turned out to be 50%  less onerous in both time and materials. The second team was able to take advantage of the requirements and designs established by the first team, using this as a slipstream to effectively speed up delivery. This new team was able to catch-up rapidly because,  as in everything (and software is no exception), it’s easier the second time round to get it right first time. With a well-defined, pre-existing backlog of requirements and the QA and BAs  able to support the second team, Pret were also able to utilise Equal Experts’ international teams  to deliver the work, with the second team able to be supported  from Pune, India. The original delivery  team members were able to effectively communicate detailed requirements and designs for this remote team to work from. Fast Follow development has been a cost-effective way for many of our clients to build out to a second mobile  app platform, and has proven a viable alternative to the less predictable efficiencies of mobile cross-platform technologies. As proven by Pret,  using this approach can be more efficient – and less of a risk than traditional methods – for cross-platform mobile app development; it also provides all the benefits which arise from using well understood native development technologies. (Depending on delivery requirements, cross-platform technologies such as Flutter do provide another viable alternative approach. For help understanding the trade-offs,  contact our experts who can provide additional  examples guidance specific  to your  project).Value Delivered: How an app improved customer engagement and increased revenue From a standing start with limited digital presence, Pret have significantly grown and are now taking their customer experience global and digital, first with web and mobile. With a consistent spot in the top of the Food & Drink category (helped by a healthy 4.9 star rating (Source: Apple,  App Store, Oct 22)  Pret says “its Coffee Subscription service, is used over one million times a week.” (Source: The Caterer / Pret). Through Pret Pick Up, Pret Perks and Pret Coffee Subscription, an ongoing relationship has been built with Pret’s most loyal and valuable customers across both UK and international markets. All this has been delivered at incredible pace and scale using the principles of Fast Follow, continuous delivery powered by  shorter feedback cycles to reduce risks when things don’t work and just as importantly capitalise on them when they DO.Summary The choice of whether to begin with a digital proposition on the web or a mobile app isn’t necessarily an obvious one. The web is the fastest and most well understood route to the broadest number of platforms, but isn’t always the way to achieve the broadest customer adoption and engagement. A Fast Follower strategy, together with a cloud-native, API-first approach gave Pret the flexibility to go to market fast with their strategic plans with short feedback loops on new propositions. It also afforded them the agility they needed to extend propositions to multiple platforms and technologies as desired, to support their business strategy. Mobile has given on-the-go customers improved convenience when engaging with retailers. A best-in-class mobile app can grow engagement and sales that far exceed the cost of adding and supporting these tools, when done well and underpinned by a platform agnostic, API-first digital platform.

2,Rethinking technology operations,"Rethinking technology operations In early 2018, John Lewis & Partners committed to reducing its annual multi-million pound opportunity costs, by replacing the monolithic COTS ecommerce platform behind johnlewis.com with tens of teams building user-centric digital services. The goal was to:  scale delivery to many product teams in parallel, to meet business demand. accelerate deployments from weekly to daily, to improve customer experience and maximise revenue. improve johnlewis.com reliability from 99.0% to 99.9%, and time to resolution from 2 hours to less than 45 mins, to minimise revenue loss and costs during major incidents. encourage teams to increase quality and share a body of accumulated knowledge, to reduce unplanned BAU work.  As part of this work, Equal Experts was asked to help create a step change in technology operations. At the time, John Lewis & Partners had separate Delivery and Operations functions, with the application support team provided as a third party managed service. Deployments could not be accelerated, johnlewis.com reliability could not be improved any further, and the vendor feared being overwhelmed by the number of planned digital services. In addition, there was a support backlog with hundreds of tasks, with an estimated revenue impact in the tens of millions. The challenge set by John Lewis & Partners was how to re-design technology operations, and embed operability into teams at scale. Equal Experts recommended moving to a You Build It You Run It operating model, in which autonomous product teams would run their own digital services and focus on business outcomes. The plan was to maximise incentives for engineers to build operability into digital services, and free up the application support team to concentrate on critical COTS applications.Paving a road for incident response At the time, John Lewis & Partners and Equal Experts were building the John Lewis & Partners Digital Platform (JLDP), to handle the ever-growing number of product teams and digital services. A digital platform is a collection of paved roads, providing fault-free and frictionless user journeys for product teams. It was important to add an incident response paved road to JLDP. To be comfortable with the You Build It You Run It principle of on-call product teams, engineers needed incident response to be streamlined. The existing workflow involved multiple handoffs:  An analyst created a ServiceNow ticket, started a private chat room, and phoned an application support analyst. The application support analyst worked to resolve the incident, and phoned an incident manager for major incidents. The incident manager coordinated urgent response efforts between multiple teams, and handled stakeholder communications.  A fully automated workflow was implemented for digital services in JLDP, which used the PagerDuty incident response platform to connect microservices with Slack and ServiceNow. JLDP automatically provisions a new digital service as an on-call policy and team rota in PagerDuty. When an alert is fired:  PagerDuty automatically creates a ServiceNow ticket, and calls the on-call product team engineer immediately. The product team engineer creates a public chat room, works to resolve the incident, and contacts an incident manager for major incidents. The incident manager coordinates urgent response efforts between multiple teams, and handles stakeholder communications.   Incorporating as-is incident management was vital. John Lewis & Partners had incident managers who were skilled facilitators and communicators, and they lightened cognitive load for on-call engineers during incident response. Incident managers were modelled as a PagerDuty on-call team rota, and could be phoned during an incident with a single button click in PagerDuty. The incident response paved road was a key step in the operability journey for John Lewis & Partners. Replacing spreadsheets and phone calls with PagerDuty alerts reduced Time To Acknowledge (TTA) from 5-20 minutes to a consistent 60 seconds. Switching from private to public chat rooms allowed anyone to learn from response efforts, during and after incidents. Implementing bi-directional sync between PagerDuty and ServiceNow improved data capture quality in incident tickets, and allowed customer service teams to contact product teams by simply raising a ServiceNow ticket.Balancing outcomes protection with run costs The run cost of You Build It You Run It at scale was a concern at the outset for John Lewis & Partners. It was assumed 20, 30, or 40 product teams would require 20, 30, or 40 on-call engineers, and incur a linear run cost. Early conversations focused on You Build It You Run It as an insurance policy for business outcomes, and the need to optimise run costs without weakening operability incentives for engineers. The answer was to link availability level and on-call level to a financial exposure band – the expected revenue loss and operational costs in an incident. Financial exposure bands and availability levels were sourced from a pre-existing John Lewis & Partners policy. Product managers were asked to estimate the maximum financial exposure for each digital service. A service availability calculator was then used to assign an availability target and on-call level. This process incentivised product managers to prioritise operational features alongside product features, and brought opportunity costs into the same conversations as run costs. An example calculator is shown below, with some artificial financial exposure bands.  All product teams are on-call during working hours for their own digital services. This incentivises engineers to minimise BAU maintenance work, and implement operational features such as monitoring dashboards, message queues, and circuit breakers. Out of hours, teams have the following guidelines:  Low exposure. A team has nobody on-call out of hours, and no operations support. This pushes engineers to still invest in operational features, to minimise incident resolution on the next working day. Medium exposure. Teams in the same product domain are recommended to rotate one engineer on-call for their combined digital services. Product domains are used as affinity groupings, to encourage a focus on business outcomes and a low cognitive load. High exposure. A team has one engineer on-call for their digital services. This ensures the fastest possible time to restore.  The below example shows some digital services at John Lewis & Partners. The basket, electricals, fashion, and upholstery services are part of the same Commercial Journeys product domain, so each night one person is on-call from the three teams for the four services.Assessing on-call product teams Initially, You Build It You Run It caused some concerns from product team engineers, who had not been on-call before. Understanding and overcoming their fears, by openly discussing and addressing them, was just as important as changes to processes and tools. The operating model now receives very positive feedback from product teams, who are constantly learning by building and running their own digital services at scale. The rate of deployments has dramatically increased, and in-incident financial losses have fallen. A good example of this was Black Friday 2020, which saw record user traffic due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The johnlewis.com website performed well, and online sales were 50% higher than 2019. In 2021, John Lewis & Partners and Equal Experts ran a cost/benefit analysis on two years of data, which validated the value proposition of You Build It You Run It. In deployment throughput, product teams averaged one deploy every 3 days, whereas the application support team averaged weekly deployments with high variability.  In service reliability, on-call product teams had fewer incidents with a financial loss than the third party managed service, and their time to restore was much faster. 44 digital services had a Mean Time To Recovery (MTTR) of 27 mins with low variability. The application support team had an MTTR of 1 hour with high variability.  The table below shows that You Build It You Run It was superior in terms of scale, throughput, and reliability. It includes a revenue protection effectiveness measure, which was devised for a fair comparison between the two operating models despite their differing teams, services, and ranges of financial exposure. Revenue protection effectiveness was defined as the % of expected revenue loss per incident that was realised, based on the time to restore. You Build It You Run it was more effective, year on year.","{""questions"": [""What is the goal of John Lewis & Partners?"", ""What is the goal of Equal Experts?"", ""What is the goal of the John Lewis & Partners Digital Platform?"", ""What is the goal of the incident response paved road?"", ""What is the goal of the You Build It You Run It operating model?"", ""What is the goal of the You Build It You Run It operating model?"", ""What is the goal of the You Build It You Run It operating model?"", ""What is the goal of the You Build It You Run It operating model?"", ""What is the goal of the You Build It You Run It operating model?"", ""What is the goal of the You Build It You Run It operating model?""]}"
3,Starting small,"Starting small In spring 2018, a small, hand-picked team started a period of 6 weeks discovery. Their brief was simple. How could John Lewis & Partners migrate search away from the old system and enable legacy decommissioning, using lean, agile practices. For a traditional retailer, this approach was new, empowering, and exciting. The decision was to go live to a small percentage of customers with a very basic version of search, and then iteratively add more features. They knew that as soon as they did go live, they would start to learn about the system’s characteristics and how customers used it.Building a team for success During Discovery the team grew and took shape. This was a combination of permanent staff from JL&P and consultants from Equal Experts. Communicating with operational stakeholders was an essential component of ensuring success. People from Operations and Middleware were co-opted, and aligned with the team from the outset. Taking time out early to agree on ways of working was time well spent. The team wanted to have just enough process to deliver reliably without overheads. Very importantly, the whole team was responsible for quality. To do this they embraced continuous delivery, employed kanban-style working with a strict standup and ticket discipline. The team was the first to adopt You Build It You Run It at John Lewis & Partners, and first to use the Paved Road on the John Lewis & Partners Digital Platform (JLDP).  The team started with three microservices, and one Elasticsearch cluster. This more than doubled, with new microservices being added when it was obvious a technical challenge was becoming a separate capability.Peak 2018 at 1% When there are events and reasons to celebrate, people go shopping. The biggest event for John Lewis & Partners is often referred to as The Peak. This includes Black Friday in late November, the run-up to Christmas, and the Boxing Day sale. Peak planning meant debating many potential disaster scenarios. The incumbent search API was still available and, because the new API format was the same, it was easy to direct traffic to either API without impact on customers. This was done using an A/B testing tool, and 1% of customers used cloud search on Black Friday. The performance had been tested to way beyond 1%, so it wasn’t surprising that the service coped. It was good to know there was the capability to scope up if needed, as the existing search system was known to periodically struggle under load.Tuning search The higher the traffic, the faster you learn. By summer 2019, cloud search was at 100% live traffic and tuning was underway. Tuning is hard because you need to understand what the customer was thinking when they typed in multiple, seemingly unconnected words. Many different approaches were tried, including weighting fields differently, using synonyms, and stemming. The team was releasing changes daily to production, which enabled a lot of experimentation. Now using data science to inform ranking algorithms, a data scientist and machine learning expert joined the team. The flexible architecture meant it was easy to ingest new data from new sources. This data would be run through the team’s data pipelines, analysing and processing it, to provide near-real-time customisation of search engine behaviour.Peak 2019 at 100% For Black Friday 2019, the fallback to legacy search was no longer a viable option, and there were questions about You Build It You Run It. How would issues be dealt with, and what was the target response time for an incident? Keeping operational stakeholders closely involved was a priority. The team worked on its performance testing, monitoring, and alerting, until they had complete confidence. The average uptime across Black Friday, Christmas, and Boxing Day sales was 100%, and Cloud Search API response times were consistently good at 0.1s average, and 0.3s at 95th percentile. With a search dashboard up in the office, everyone got used to seeing it at standup and reviewing it quickly for any anomalies.Building into the future The last bit of functionality to move off the legacy search was typeahead suggestions which were released in January 2020. This cleared the way for decommissioning the legacy search system. After more than a year of iterating ranking algorithms and refining A/B testing techniques, a simple algorithm produced significant and consistent lifts in important metrics like conversion and revenue per session. John Lewis & Partners has estimated the new algorithm will bring in over £30m in extra revenue per year. Machine Learning is now applied to search results and makes turnaround for A/B testing much quicker. Over 100 A/B tests have been run to continually identify opportunities for search improvements. When the pandemic hit in March 2020 and shops closed, online shopping doubled overnight. The search team handled this without any problems, and they’re still going strong in 2022. They’ve averaged daily deployments for over 2 years, with an incident rate much lower than the legacy search system. The seismic online shift in retail has been accelerated by the pandemic and the search transformation has underpinned John Lewis’ ability to adapt.","{""questions"": [""What is the teams goal?"", ""What is the teams approach to quality?"", ""What is the teams approach to testing?"", ""What is the teams approach to deployment?"", ""What is the teams approach to data science?""]}"
4,Harnessing API technology for entitlement checking and streamlined access to scholarly content,"Harnessing API technology for entitlement checking and streamlined access to scholarly content Researchers are increasingly using discovery services that are disconnected from publisher entitlements. This means that, when discovering articles, researchers are often unaware if their institution has provided access. This can lead to frustrating user journeys, with researchers clicking on article links, navigating publisher and aggregator websites to find out how to access content, only to be told at the very end that they do not have access. Early research conducted by Equal Experts showed that researchers can click up to ten times before accessing an article. With GetFTR this is reduced to one click, or two if they haven’t yet signed in via their institution. When trying to read content across multiple publisher platforms, this increases the complexity as the researcher must authenticate for each platform. Equal Experts developed a backend API that enables discovery tools to check entitlements at the article level directly with the publisher. Where the researcher’s institution subscribes, the researcher is provided with a GetFTR smartlink from within their discovery service, which takes them directly to the article. If the institution uses federated authentication, and the researcher isn’t already authenticated, they will be taken directly to their institution login page removing the need to navigate publisher websites. Additionally, they only need to authenticate once to access content from all participating publisher platforms.  Equal Experts also developed a Self-Service Portal providing a number of tools, to ensure the onboarding process was smooth for both publishers and integrators. We also developed a Demo Discovery Service to illustrate how GetFTR works, and to support Publisher and Integrator decisions on whether to come onboard.Adopting a test and learn approach to improve through iteration We started an initial 3 month engagement to deliver a functional prototype. GetFTR was pleased with the prototype and the contract was extended for an additional 9 months to support piloting and further development of the service. There were some initial challenges with the distributed architecture and authentication options provided in version 1 of the API. Following the pilot, version 2 was released, which supported IP authentication alongside federated authentication. Additionally, Integrators could now send DOI entitlement requests in batches. The service uses CloudFront Functions to operate right at the edge of the AWS network, which makes it massively scalable and highly fault-tolerant against outages affecting other parts of the AWS network. This was critical for a service that essentially acts as an intermediary between Discovery Services and Publishers with a huge volume of requests per second. CloudFront Functions operate in a severely reduced environment, with a lot of JavaScript features turned off. It also provided the reassurance of knowing there was no additional latency, as the maximum execution time of these functions is 1ms.Demonstrating business value through scaling capacity GetFTR now works with over 30 partners across publishers, platforms and integrators and to date has returned over 800m links to high quality content, providing researchers with streamlined access to content. GetFTR has just hit the 5 billion mark for entitlement checks.","{""questions"": [""What is the main problem with discovery services?"", ""What is the main goal of GetFTR?"", ""What is the main difference between GetFTR and other discovery services?""]}"
5,,"The entertainment industry is changing rapidly, with consumer adoption of streaming services and video on demand. Our client, a global media and entertainment brand, needed to understand and improve consumer experiences on its Video on Demand platform. To do this, they needed to make content more discoverable, by collecting meta data from thousands of individual video assets, and then mapping each video to a unique, industry standard identifier. This code would help consumers to discover and search for content on demand, but that was only the start of the journey. By tracking and analysing this data, the broadcaster would be able to gain valuable insight into customer journeys. With better insight into what customers searched for, watched, and rates of customer loyalty and churn, our customer would be able to improve the consumer experience and deliver better services in future.Getting a handle on large data volumes The first challenge our customer faced was the sheer volume of data. Capturing meta data for just two years of video meant analysing more than 121 TB of data. It was important that the process of collecting meta data, mapping to new codes, and integrating this information with the customers’ analytics and reporting tools was as seamless and fast as possible. Without data expertise in-house, our client was struggling to optimise these processes. Equal Experts developed a new data platform for the client in 12 weeks, that was capable of processing data queries in under than 5 minutes, costing less than $5,000 per month.Delivering the data health check As part of our work with this customer, Equal Experts Data Studio carried out a Data Health Check, which identified a number of challenges that were slowing down the upfront collection, mapping and analysis of video data. A data health check is an independent assessment of a client’s data processes, that is usually carried out over a period of two weeks. Each check is unique and tailored to the customer’s particular challenges and goals. An expert team examines all aspects of the data journey to identify issues around data quality, performance and efficiency. At the end of the health check, clients will receive a checklist that includes recommended improvements and advice to help the client improve their data processes. Our data health check identified a number of challenges with the media company’s data processes relating to this project. In particular, there were inconsistencies around how data was imported into the system, leading to less reliable analytics data. Some data was imported to the system manually in CSV files while other data was pulled from a database in a materialised view. The issue was compounded because data pulled from the database lagged, leading to a 24-hour delay in some cases and creating inconsistencies between different data sets. In addition, our customer used three different tools for data analytics and reporting, which meant that some reports needed to be manually created by pulling data from multiple platforms, as well as increasing the risk of data inconsistencies and duplication.Recommendations and results As part of the data health check, we provided recommendations to the customer on how to fix or mitigate these issues. First, we advised the organisation to switch to a fully automated data import process. This immediately improved consistency and reduced the data lag from 24 hours to just under 2 hours. We also advised the client to standardise on the Metabase reporting tool, which combined:  Native SQL report creation Easy to use dashboards with the ability to embed dashboards on external sites Slack and email notifications Good user management Anomaly detection  Making this change further improved the accuracy and reliability of analytics data. Our client recognised the data health check would be most effective as more than a one-off check. One year after our first report, the EE team conducted a follow-up Data Health Check to help the customer understand the potential for further improvement in its data processes. Once again, our team performed a comprehensive check of the customer’s data systems, processes and reporting. We identified two key areas where additional improvements could be made.Data Pipeline First, we advised the customer that thinking about data as pipelines would help to deliver faster, more accurate data analytics. Previously, data imports were being managed within a single Clojure project. This offered limited flexibility to change schedules or create new data ingestions . Adopting a data pipeline approach allows for data from multiple sources to be automatically moved to a single destination as required. This would allow the organisation to schedule, re-schedule and manually trigger data ingestion, making the process more efficient. In addition, a pipeline would give the customer an overview of the status of current and completed data ingestions.Business logic Second, our data health check revealed that the application of business logic in data analytics was slow and complex to change. To improve this process, we recommended using a tool called DBT, which allows organisations to rewrite business logic and then create or view associated documentation in a user-friendly interface. This new approach allowed our customer to:  Centralise the analytics business logic Enrich data transformation with testing Create and view documentation for data Improve data processing times from 2 hours to 10 minutes  As a result of the changed made through these Data Health Checks, our customer has achieved savings of $3 million, with a 20% increase in data quality, using optimised insights. The result is that the company is able to be more competitive, offering a positive experience to consumers.","{""questions"": [""What is the main challenge the company faced?"", ""What is the main challenge the company faced?"", ""What is the main challenge the company faced?""]}"

7,The challenges of legacy technology and processes,"The challenges of legacy technology and processes In a fiercely competitive market it is essential for organisations to get innovative digital services to market as quickly as possible. Our customers had some experience with digital delivery but didn’t feel able to execute strategies fully using existing people, partners, processes and tools. All of our customers had large, existing IT infrastructure and a digital presence that was not reaching its potential. It was hard to know where to invest in new services for the best results, and slow legacy platforms and processes made it hard to implement changes and respond to customer feedback quickly. Services that were already running needed a lot of maintenance, which meant less resource available to innovate at scale. These constraints caused long delays when launching new services with many organisations struggling with a concept to cash timeline that took over 18 months. This made it hard to deliver return on investment (ROI) from digital services. Each organisation wanted to overhaul digital strategy over a period of two to three years, by creating a modern digital platform that could be used to launch new customer-facing services such as subscription, loyalty and government services. In most cases, customers had considered other products and partnerships, but chose to work with Equal Experts because we have a long history of enabling organisations to deliver on digital strategy. “One of the main reasons we liked Equal Experts was they’d achieved a very strong digital transformation with [a previous customer], and we thought that a lot of that was applicable for us too.” — Delivery and operations manager, retail Equal Experts was brought on board to help customers build and scale a digital platform that would simplify and accelerate the delivery of digital services, while improving in-house skills and knowledge.Enabling digital delivery at scale Our priority was to create a new cloud platform to host services that could be scaled, developed and amended quickly and efficiently. With each of the organisations in the study we built a digital platform, which consisted of a suite of paved roads to provide a self-service and seamless experience to consuming development teams. These development teams worked in parallel as users of the platform to design and deliver new digital services. With each new consuming team the platform evolved to enable and meet their needs with the specific goals of reducing their time to market and improving the quality and reliability of their output. This resulted in a platform of paved roads that provided fully automated, self-service cloud infrastructure. This was important to help with rapid scaling the digital delivery organisation by ensuring new teams could be effective from day one. We also helped our customers adopt a “you build it, you run it” operating model, with a paved road for incident response. This allowed new digital services to be more reliable, with less outages and downtime. The combination of paved roads developed to enable delivery teams and optimising the delivery organisation around a “you build it you run it” delivery model enabled the customers we worked with to seamlessly scale their delivery capability. With one organisation this approach supported them scaling from a small number of teams to around 80 teams over a three year period. By investing in this approach other customers have been able to scale teams up and down based on their needs and budget as the paved roads make it simpler to onboard and offboard developers and get them up to speed.Reducing time to market and delivering better customer experiences Developing a new digital platform didn’t just provide business agility and allow teams to be scaled up and down. The greatest benefit was a significant reduction in time to market for new digital services, with one customer seeing a reduction in the concept-to-cash timeline from 24 months to around six months. The Forrester study found that reducing time to market was the largest single driver of return on investment. “Before Equal Experts, our concept-to-cash timeline was around 18 to 24 months. Whereas, in 2018, that was reduced to about six months. I think it would be even faster now.” – Delivery and operations manager, retail Faster time to market means that organisations can start to generate revenues sooner, and to update existing and new services more quickly, in response to customer needs. The range of new services and higher availability means a better experience for customers, which is enhanced by faster customer feedback loops. Internally, development teams are working with cutting edge technologies that reduce time to market, allowing the team to focus on delivering innovation rather than complex updates and maintenance issues. Alongside this change, customers have seen lower staff turnover, with improved engagement and retention among developer teams$61 million benefits from reduced costs and increased revenues Forrester Research examined and compiled the benefits delivered from multiple customer projects into one, theoretical organisation. By partnering with Equal Experts, the composite organisation was able to develop and launch new services more quickly. Key benefits of the partnership included faster time to market, increased business revenues and higher service reliability. Over a period of three years, Equal Experts helped the composite organisation to build and run a new digital platform, launch multiple differentiated digital services and embed a ‘you build it, you run it’ operating model. The first new digital service was launched after seven months, 11 months earlier than expected. The adoption of ‘paved roads’ allowed for new services to be developed and delivered more quickly, generating 21 months of extra revenue in the first year of the project alone. This shorter delivery cycle generated an additional $41 million in profits for the organisation, by launching services and generating revenue earlier. Each new digital service contributed $15 million on average in additional revenue. The services built with Equal Experts tended to outperform other services, generating 60% more revenue than those built outside the custom digital platform. This benefit was evident even after the project had finished. The ‘paved road’ approach led to a reduction in manual effort managing environments for digital delivery teams. The composite organisation saved 13,000 hours of engineering time by developing paved roads to automate the provisioning and management of environments. This provided an estimated benefit of $716,000 over a three year period. “We’ve been able to change the building of environments for a new product from a six-month project for provisioning all the infrastructure down to one day. Actually, even in a couple of hours we can spin it up now.” — Platform and operations manager, retail During peak periods, the business can offer reliable and scalable services that cope with peaks in demand easily. For every minute that a digital service was unavailable, the retailer could lose an average of $4,000. Over three years, it’s estimated that the new digital platform would protect against losses in the region of $544,000. “We used to be in a position where getting ready for Black Friday was a significant challenge. Equal Experts and their consultants have been able to help us reengineer our platform and our technology practices. We were able to go way beyond our typical levels of performance without any issue.” – Delivery and operations Manager, retail This study from Forrester demonstrates the commercial value that can be realised through reducing time to market and reducing costs by:  investing in building paved roads to improve the effectiveness of development teams and, adopting a “you build it you run it” delivery model to simplify the delivery organisation.

8,Applying Data Science and ML to improve customer engagement and sales,"Applying Data Science and ML to improve customer engagement and sales The first iteration of the initiative had been developed with another  partner. It was built on a proprietary vendor platform with significant annual licence fees. The vendor platform had limited data observability, and this made it harder for the business to understand the outcomes of the ML models.  Equal Experts started with an exemplar use case for a single brand. We built the new digital data platform using standard AWS components including Lambdas, SNS, SQS, RDS, Managed workflows with data observability baked in.We used good software engineering principles including automated tests, continuous integration and deployment pipelines. This enabled the team to get rapid feedback from the business and improve outcomes. We were also able to deliver outcomes faster and with a much smaller team, compared to the incumbent partner. The following models were delivered:  Machine learning models helped the business leverage historical data to predict future behaviour and target customers with more precise, personalised engagement, instead of sending generic marketing emails. Delivering exactly the right message at the right time in the customer journey resulted in increased sales from each interaction.How small teams can generate rapid return on investment through continual iterative developments From the start, the goal was to build a platform deeply aligned with Travelopia’s business strategy of understanding customers and delivering targeted value. The previous version of this project took 18 months to go live. The new iteration took just 3 months to build and deliver, 6 times faster than the previous version. The new platform started to deliver value very quickly, with a 3% revenue uplift within the first month, and 30% increase in sales generated just 3 months after starting the project. Sales continued to grow month on month, with costs being recovered in less than 6 months, despite the challenging business environment during the pandemic. The business currently attributes about 4 percentage points of revenue to the new platform to date (9 months since the first delivery). The customer is also saving £300K per year on licensing costs. The simpler architecture and the “You Build It, You Run It” mindset employed by Equal Experts meant that the team was able to deliver impressive results with just 6 consultants (4 from Equal Experts, and 2 from Travelopia). Getting results quickly was made possible by the very close working relationship Equal Experts consultants had with our customers. We worked in 6-8 week iterations, each with a specific business objective to be tested in production. Learning from each other, this iterative approach allowed us to continually deliver value and improve outcomes.When starting small leads to business transformations at scale Once the platform for one brand was fully up and running, we then started replicating the success for other Travelopia brands. The next brand had very similar results with an even shorter time for completion, due to the lessons learned on the previous iteration. The project has had strategic visibility at board level, with progress and impact monitored on an ongoing basis. Having seen  the effectiveness of the platform in the first slice, other brands signed up to leverage the new digital data platform for their businesses. In terms of scale, Travelopia is a $1 billion+ company, and this will be an ongoing strategic project with a revenue share of 3-4 percentage points  across the whole business.","{""questions"": [""What is the goal of the project?"", ""What is the difference between the new platform and the previous version?"", ""What is the difference between the new platform and the previous version?"", ""What is the difference between the new platform and the previous version?"", ""What is the difference between the new platform and the previous version?""]}"
9,MeasureSMS – an example of corporate social responsibility in tech,"MeasureSMS – an example of corporate social responsibility in tech  MeasureSMS is a software product which collects data about illnesses in remote locations via SMS text messaging. It was built primarily for use in countries with underdeveloped infrastructure and poor 3G/4G signals. SMS is usually the most effective form of long-range communication in these areas, allowing data to be relayed to an internet-enabled phone, and then onto a central service. Collecting data about diseases and illnesses in these remote areas allows LSTM to support national governments to manage specific conditions with supplies and specialists ahead of interventions. It ensures affected populations can be treated effectively in the future. Some of these illnesses have serious and long-lasting implications, but are easily treatable with the correct medicines and expertise. MeasureSMS allows field agents working in small, remote villages (e.g. in Ethiopia or Malawi) to communicate an incidence of disease or injury (e.g. snake bite) via text message, which is then relayed via an internet-enabled phone to LSTM’s data services. LSTM’s COO Siân Freer talks about the value the project has brought to the charity: “Allocating scarce resources is a challenge faced by all countries. MeasureSMS has enabled us and our partners in endemic countries to identify areas of high disease burden, so that resources can be targeted to support those suffering from disabling, life limiting conditions.”Rebuilding to modernise in a basic android world Following a major incident which resulted in losing the legacy platform behind MeasureSMS, LSTM needed to completely rebuild with modern technologies, to reinstate and improve on the existing capabilities of the system. The challenge was going to be marrying this degree of modernisation to the technically outdated hardware constraints (2G phones used in remote locations), restrictions inherent in the hosting environment (we needed to use 8.1+ PHP for the backend) and the limitations of Android 7 (required due to the existing internet phones used as relays). At the beginning of this piece of work, the website was offline after the earlier incident. In the process of reinstating the platform, it became clear that the hosting service was no longer able to support the PHP 5.6 backups available. Given that there was also a lot of outdated legacy code which wasn’t compliant with new requirements such as GDPR, the decision was made to rebuild the product to improve the existing system. Our EvolvE team needed to build a minimum viable product (MVP) as quickly as possible, to get the original functionality back up and running. However they also wanted to ensure that the new product could support additional features in the latest technologies. The priorities were:  Rebuild the API Rebuild the Android app Build a simple frontend to manage users, view data and graphs, and export data from the system in CSV format.  Essentially, what happens in the improved system is this: field agents using 2G phones send SMS messages in a pre-defined format to an android phone with internet capability, which operates as a relay to forward the message to an API endpoint at LSTM.Managing tropical medicine at scale The previous Android app had been built using Java, and only carried out basic validation of 4 diseases, responding to field agents in English. The team quickly identified the need to be able to track the multiple types of tropical illness prevalent in the populations they serve, so instead, they used Kotlin, adding the capability to record an infinite number of diseases. LSTM can now also respond in 4 languages via the new API, depending on the language received from the field agent. Eventually it will be able to respond in any language. These two improvements are a huge step forward in LSTM’s ability to track and monitor disease incidence, and enable them to better equip medical teams on future visits to manage (and potentially eliminate) serious conditions from the population.What next for MeasureSMS and EvolvE? This is an ongoing CSR engagement and we are constantly developing and iterating on the product as we maintain it for LSTM. As well as increasing the number of trackable illnesses and adding the ability to manage those in any language, these are some of the improvements we’re working on:  Inventory management: we’ve built functionality into the API that will enable LSTM to use the product for inventory management in the future. Because the new system can handle an unlimited number of illnesses, it’s also possible to build an unlimited inventory, improving reporting and identification of patterns. Upskilling the team: current goals involve making the process of reporting and responding to and from the API as efficient as possible so that people can learn to use the application easily. For example, existing field agents often don’t send messages in the required format – new updates will ensure field agents are sent back a useful error message and instructions on how to send in the required format – the errors will be sent in the field agents’ native language. In the future, it may even be possible to send the API-generated responses in a bot format, giving automated responses and requests for information from field agents. This would carry a cost implication, so will be a decision for LSTM.  MeasureSMS is a win:win engagement for both Equal Experts and LSTM; with the shift to more modern, agile technologies, EvolvE participants have used their non-billable hours to gain experience of disciplines outside of their normal remit. This has allowed our people to cross-skill from their usual backend work to Android app development, or DevOps specialism working on the frontend, all whilst providing a valuable, free of charge development service to the charity.","{""questions"": [""What is the main goal of MeasureSMS?"", ""What is the main goal of EvolvE?"", ""What are some of the improvements EvolvE is working on?""]}"
10,,"A step change from vision to reality – transforming Twyn’s prototype fast through multi-level early engagement The Equal Experts/Twyn team began the project with a 3-6-12 jump start. Breaking the project down into time-boxed initiatives forced us to quickly test ideas and mitigate technical unknowns before ramping up the fidelity for the next phase. The first slice, delivered in just 3 weeks, was to build a steel thread allowing a user to open the app, ask a question of a `Twyn` and receive a response. This would involve things like Speech Recognition, a round trip to the Core AI platform and the nascent custom-built CMS. By 6 weeks we had iterated on the early version and the team were able to validate technical concepts such as a Twyn `idle` state, the option to close a conversation, improvements to distribution and the ability to interrupt a Twyn. By 12 weeks we had deprecated the early prototype and rebuilt the app with production-ready code into something that would ultimately be submitted to Apple’s App Store for beta distribution. Working alongside Twyn’s design partner from the beginning allowed us to build in high fidelity functionality in both user experience and design, at each stage of the 3-6-12 process.Partnering with a celebrity Twyn to design the ultimate immersive online experience After the initial 12 week period, the team set a goal of releasing a standalone `powered-by Twyn` app to the App Store featuring the illusionist Derren Brown. The aim of this release was to get unmoderated feedback from real users on the efficacy of the Twyn concept. During this phase we worked with the Twyn team to identify and prioritise the biggest risks to the success of the launch. For example, how would we know when the AI was good enough? How would we ensure sufficiently low latency? How would we avoid repetition from the Twyn? As we tested further and gathered user feedback, we leveraged the app distribution platforms, App Center, TestFlight and App Store to deliver the capability to run numerous types of tests, both moderated and in the live public-facing app. The specific area of value for Twyn was to test the relevance of the AI responses, which we captured and used to train the model further. We have since also developed a system of conversation links including feature toggles allowing the team to target different Twyns to different cohorts of testers via different distribution platforms.User Testing and learning cycles – how rigorous testing enables complex product solutions As we worked through the initial 3-6-12 week roadmap and beyond towards the launch of the Derren app, it became clear that some degree of structured user research would prove beneficial for the team to understand how users were responding to the various app features. That’s when we embarked on a series of moderated experiments led by a dedicated User Researcher. Topics of interest included navigation, interactivity, narrative structure and conversation repair. We facilitated this with an experimentation backlog in MS DevOps which allowed Product Owners to make sure we were testing the highest priority (or highest risk) items. Each experiment was refined in a similar way to a regular backlog item, with a hypothesis, a purpose and an agreement as to how it would be conducted. This ensured a shared understanding across all involved parties. We also ensured we had a Definition of Done, along with success metrics for each, which product Owners revisited weekly to ensure aligned and timely adjustments.Delivering sustainable innovation – how Equal Experts supported the client to inherit a capability and delivery process they could own for future development The original concept was to build an app capable of hosting multiple Twyns, for users to browse and choose who they would interact with. As we worked with the Twyn team it became clear that we had multiple use cases that were differentiated enough to warrant multiple Twyn apps. Working collaboratively with the entire Twyn team early in the product development lifecycle allowed us to develop a product that fulfils multiple validated needs. Tywn now has 5 apps powered from a single ‘core’ codebase. Each app has taken the learnings of its predecessors, along with the understanding from our user research. The outcome of this iterative approach is a user experience that is more likely to be commercially viable should Twyn decide to charge for content in the future. The crucial factor in this project was to build products flexible enough to adapt to the Twyn team’s evolving objectives. To allow for the iteration towards a viable value proposition, the team have built a suite of apps powered by a flexible, bespoke Content Management System. As EE exited the engagement in September 2021, the product, platform and tooling that exists today looks quite different from that which was originally envisaged. We have one app live in the App Store (Derren Brown), one ready to go live (a celebrity endorsed cycling-themed app), another in TestFlight to facilitate rapid testing cycles (Creator), a multi-Twyn app for investor demos and one in development due to go live in 2022 (a celebrity endorsed surfing-themed app) – five apps in total. EE worked with Twyn closely to shape and support hiring of internal capability and a handover approach that allowed Twyn to inherit the delivery process and evolve the product going forward. The CMS tool is becoming increasingly adopted by Twyn’s content production team, allowing them to upload and manage video clips, chapters, prompts and other app-specific content assets. It’s also an important tool for the conversation designers to understand user utterances and prepare new datasets to train the AI model. The project to rebuild the app in Flutter is also well in progress and we have gone live with a ‘Let’s Speak English’ English language practice app. This will facilitate a wider user base. The next important milestone will be in early 2022 when the plan is to release the surfing-themed app through Flutter to paid subscribers. It was the cohesive approach across both the Equal Experts and Twyn teams in the very early stages, along with fast functionality testing afforded by the 3-6-12 model which allowed for this impressive evolution.

11,Answering the crucial question: to buy or to build?,"Answering the crucial question: to buy or to build? Strandbags was in the midst of a move to Shopify (enterprise version), which was central to their digital transformation. While the project represented a major undertaking for the organisation, the team had been thus far happy with the progress. There was a growing issue, however, in managing their digital assets. Particularly, the large library of product images for every stock keeping unit. This library needed to be properly managed and maintained for reusability—a potentially time consuming and cumbersome process. We wanted to leave Strandbags with clarity on both the ideal solution and a full implementation path for the right DAM. The DAM is a crucial system for any retailer, but particularly so for one of Strandbag’s scale, with a large inventory and dynamic footprint of both brick-and-mortar and online sales. The consequences of an inadequate DAM can be far-reaching and incredibly costly. We needed to make sure that whichever solution and advice related to the DAM we provided would grow with the business and adapt to its changing needs.Understanding the ‘As Is’ The first part of any of our discovery work involves defining and understanding the current landscape as is. We do this by gathering a full picture of the business landscape and customers, and by mapping the current architecture and any technological solutions in place. This is usually achieved within the first week of a two-week discovery process. It’s crucial at this stage to first focus on the ‘why’ – (why, how, what model). Too often we see business leaders focus solely on the ‘what’. In this case, for example, the mistake would have been a narrow focus on the DAM itself, rather than keeping close attention to the goals the DAM needed to achieve and the broader business objectives surrounding this engagement. By focusing on the ‘why’ first, followed by the ‘how’ and ‘what’, you are less likely to make costly and misguided decisions during a digital project or transformation.Applying ‘Marty v Martin’ One approach we regularly return to at Equal Experts is referred to as “Marty v Martin”. Marty here refers to the work of Marty Cagan. Marty believes a successful product must be “valuable, usable and feasible”. Learn more about the Marty v Martin approach. The ‘Martin’ component refers to another leader in product thinking, Martin Eriksson. Specifically, Martin’s well-known Venn diagram highlighting his view of “product management as the intersection between business, technology and user experience”. When we overlay Marty Cagan’s “valuable, usable, feasible” imperative with Martin Eriksson’s “business, technology, user experience” method, we can achieve a comprehensive and incisive analysis.What comes after you choose to buy? From here, we started to scope and evaluate the prospective platforms based on the valuable, usable and feasible criteria. Initially, this involved narrowing our options by deciding on whether to purchase a solution as Infrastructure as a Service (IAAS), Platform as a Service (PAAS) or Software as a Service (SAAS). For Strandbags, the selection of SAAS was clear as there was no desire to own the application or the data housed within it. This left us with a handful of suitable candidates to consider. From here we evaluated each option based on their suitability and available integrations. We helped Strandbags select the right off-the-shelf DAM that would meet all necessary criteria while being able to integrate with Shopify and the other existing technical platforms, being Shogun CMS and Adobe Suite. This narrowed the list to two remaining DAM candidates. One of these DAM providers’ Implementation and Sales Teams had already started to build a great relationship with our client. To make the final call, we suggested Strandbags allow that positive relationship to guide their choice, since this would factor highly on the “valuable” criteria. Ultimately it was a clear and simple decision, but vitally, one underpinned by some sophisticated and collaborative analysis.    Post-discovery: supporting clients to continue, pivot or stop Our team is always cognisant of getting the best value outcomes for every client we partner with. This extends to saving our clients time and money wherever possible. Sometimes it also involves slowing down the process and recommending teams look beyond Equal Experts for specific or niche support. This was the case during this engagement. Following a successful discovery engagement, Strandbags requested we continue our partnership in implementing the DAM. While we could do this, we also recognised the value in using the included implementation support provided by the DAM team first. This was more economical from Strandbag’s perspective, and thus a sensible next step. Honesty—along with transparency and integrity—is always the best policy. We also helped guide Strandbags on a range of other digital projects so they could better prioritise and plan them in a well-paced way. For us, it’s about long-term relationships, not short-term revenue; delivering a great deal of value for the client to result in a high-trust, ongoing partnership. We were pleased to help Strandbags continue on the trajectory of our discovery – autonomously and with the right support in place. The DAM was successfully implemented and has helped fuel the retailer’s eCommerce growth through a volatile 2020/2021.","{""questions"": [""What is the DAM?"", ""What is the DAMs importance to a retailer?"", ""What is the DAMs importance to Strandbags?"", ""What is the DAMs importance to the customer?"", ""What is the DAMs importance to Equal Experts?""]}"
12,,"Making information available to a wider population while maintaining confidentiality The CHARISMA counselling intervention aims to empower women in vulnerable situations to use PrEP safely in their relationships. It does this by giving them access to the HEART relationship assessment and skills-focused, targeted information on either general communication and conflict negotiation, communicating about HIV prevention, or seeking help for violent relationships. The intervention helps users understand what a healthy relationship entails and to better navigate their specific situation. This intervention was administered at a single clinic located in Johannesburg. It became obvious that only by digitizing the intervention, could they make it accessible to a wider population. Equal Experts worked with RTI to deliver a new mobile site, to take the fully manual process and make it available to a wider female population in just three months.Making information and counselling accessible and available As a content heavy application, the CHARISMA tool needed to perform two roles. To assess relationships, and to provide information. It was important that all the content communicated in a way that could be understood by a range of female demographics, from varied and different backgrounds. Basically a virtual counselor. With this in mind, it was designed with UX/UI principles, to present counselling material in a manner that is relatable, conversational, and easy to understand. This was achieved by providing personalised information and action plans, helping users understand their own relationships and providing the ability to monitor improvements. Making the tool and counselling content accessible and online has given women access to relevant relationship and HIV prevention material on their mobile devices, meaning those in vulnerable situations can access the material and content in a safe location of their choosing.Technical guidance that considered scalability and cost Scalability and the use of open-source solutions were important for RTI such that the tool could be adapted and used in different settings by other interested parties at a low-cost. These were therefore kept in mind when making technical decisions. Following lean principles, we also answered RTI’s request for:  An infrastructure agnostic solution An easy to maintain solution The ability to deploy in any environment Low hosting costs  The application was containerised in Docker to support multiple cloud providers. Amazon Web Services (AWS) is RTI’s approved cloud hosting provider, with the most economical and scalable option for hosting being AWS Fargate, EFS. The APIs were built in Kotlin with KTOR for API. This allowed for a lightweight interface between the Content Management System (CMS) and the Front end that is loosely coupled. The service choice also presents an opportunity to be publicly available without impacting the CMS or Front-end side. Flutter/Dart was used for the mobile application for its ability to support both iOS and Android using a single code base.Empowering the client to own the application RTI is a research institution. This means that the content on the mobile site has to have the ability to constantly evolve. To make this possible, it was important to ensure that RTI did not have a dependency on Equal Experts for changes. The choice of CMS was key. Directus is an open-source self-hosting CMS that is affordable and user friendly. And importantly, it empowers RTI, or other future users, to customise the content as needed. In addition to implementation of this, it was important that the client team all felt comfortable with this. Here they were able to make changes in a test environment and promote them to production. This helped to build confidence in using the application and making changes prior to working on the live site.","{""questions"": [""What is the name of the intervention?"", ""What is the goal of the intervention?"", ""What is the name of the mobile site?"", ""What is the name of the CMS?"", ""What is the name of the front-end?""]}"
13,,"transaction service: which produces and consumes events to facilitate customer orders and accept various payments. reporting service: primarily used by merchants in a self-service portal, producing and consuming events for real-time display of transaction and payment information across a variety of channels. risk assessment service: which produces and consumes events while determining the potential risk associated with orders and payments. notification service: which produces and consumes events while automating communications to highlight the status, or changes in status, of orders and payments.  Whenever an order or payment is processed in the transaction service, it sends out a variety of events (which can be thought of as ‘triggers’ containing data for subsequent, automated processes) to the event backbone, Azure Event Hub. The event backbone, in turn, fires events to services which are configured to ‘listen’ to them. These listening services are configured to consume specific events related to their core business function; it’s a ‘pull’-style configuration, rather than the ‘pushing’ of data packets. Learn more about ‘receiver-driven routing’ in events  For example, if the transaction service processes 50 payments from one personal account number (PAN) in 10 minutes, an event is produced to notify the risk assessment service to take action to prevent the fraud (see section 03. ‘Using events for real-time fraud detection’). The reporting service may ‘listen’ for the same event, and provide an update that a certain payment or account is potentially compromised. Examples of event-driven processes include:  All payment processes in the transaction service. This means the complex workflows associated with payment submission, authorization, transitioning payments into escrow accounts, merchant capture, and credit reversal callback are all seamlessly automated and tracked in an immutable log. Transactional emails, SMS messages and merchant notifications are fully event-driven, ensuring both customer and merchant have real-time updates into payment status and processing. Advanced risk rules are evaluated using events to detect and prevent potential fraud in real-time. Events trigger updates to card management systems for reversal of any voided transactions. Recurring and subscription payments are automatically triggered using events. On successful completion of payment, the transaction service generates a series of events for reporting purposes. This includes everything from creating an immutable trail of payments for merchant recordkeeping, to generating reports and adding to computed dashboard data.  Events provide the power to quickly extend functionality In addition to automating processes, improving real-time insight, and enhancing the resilience of systems, event driven architectures are infinitely—and easily—extensible. For example, imagine a scenario where the above process requires the introduction of a gateway risk evaluation. Events are already being generated and fed into the event backbone; another event consumer (the risk evaluation service) can be configured to ‘listen for’ and consume that same stream of events for an entirely independent business requirement.On payment capture, a series of events are triggered to automate notifications to both you and your customer. While the notifications are being prepared and sent—which only takes a couple of seconds—all of your reporting is updated in real-time with detailed information highlighting the nature of the payment. You receive a notification, and you can view the information in your self-service portal. Critically, the varying steps in these payment validation processes can occur asynchronously in event-driven architectures. Structuring the payment process as a series of decoupled, independent mircoservices creates two crucial benefits;  Speed, and Reliability of processing.  Firstly, the various, complex steps involved in validating payments can occur in a non-linear way. This makes things faster overall, especially when compared with traditional sequential or synchronous processing. By their nature, event-driven architectures are ‘fire and forget’. In other words, there’s no compulsory requirement for a microservice to wait for a response before initiating the next step in a sequence. For example, the transaction service might receive a payment, fire an event to the reporting service to create a log of that payment being received, and begin the process of validating that payment. This process can occur entirely independent of the reporting service acknowledging to the transaction service that a log has been created and saved in the reporting database.These efficiencies may seem small in isolation, but at scale—when large enterprises or national retailers are processing tens or hundreds of thousands of payments per hour—the impact for processing and customer experience can be huge.For example, the transaction service might receive a payment, fire an event to the reporting service to create a log of that payment being received, and begin the process of validating that payment. This process can occur entirely independent of the reporting service acknowledging to the transaction service that a log has been created and saved in the reporting database. In addition to speed, asynchronous processing and event driven architectures break the chains of interdependencies commonly seen in synchronous structures like REST or gRPC. This drastically reduces the risk of service degradation cascading across multiple microservices.An event-driven self-service portal makes life easy for merchants Merchants can access a self-service portal which offers:  Full visibility of every transaction’s status across all channels; from initial authorisation to capture. An event-driven architecture ensures merchants can access and understand all payments in play, as they’re processed in real-time. Configurable gateway risk rules—from blocking certain countries to increasing online transaction limits—which use events to predict and protect against fraudulent transactions.

14,Defining and understanding events,"Defining and understanding events Events are effectively incredibly versatile messages which are generated when certain actions are completed in the digital bank’s platform, or in any one of the systems connected to the digital bank’s platform. Events are stored in immutable logs called ‘topics’ and received by event ‘consumers’. An event can trigger subsequent actions or business processes immediately, or can be stored for an indefinite period of time until another combination of events, or catalytic number of events, initiates the designated action. Examples of events can include:  A customer profile is created or updated An account is created A transaction occurs A customer applies for a loan A customer is approved for a loan An eKYC check is completed for identity verification‘Always on’ access to key banking functions and features Frustratingly, many large-scale banks still partake in inconvenient scheduled maintenance; the dreaded “we will be offline to perform updates from 11pm to 3am”. With our event driven architecture, the digital bank’s core banking platform is entirely decoupled from the customer mobile app. This means a reduction in dependencies between systems and therefore less risk of outages to service. From a customer’s perspective, it means the app and many of its key functions are effectively ‘always on’. As a result, core banking applications could be taken offline—for downtime or database predictions—without disrupting key customer experiences. Even with the core banking platform offline, people can still use the mobile app to check balances, view detailed transaction histories, lock accounts or cards, and more.  Create opportunities for deeper customer engagements, even before they’re designed Unless they are specifically engineered to retain change logs over time, most monolithic systems only provide a singular, current view of your data as it exists today. With the digital bank’s ability to access a full history of events from the inception of a specific topic, we can apply historical data to evolving business considerations. For example, we might consider building a new loyalty feature into the customer-facing mobile app. In order for the new feature to work, customers may need to match a specific behavioural profile from the past 12 months; perhaps they have to deposit more than $8,000 into the app in a number of consecutive months. With our event driven architecture, we can easily build out a historical data profile of specific customers, feed it into a new service, and begin applying the new customer feature where it’s relevant, as it is triggered. The next time a customer processes the necessary number and amount of deposits, they get immediate access to the new feature. Better understand customer journeys and motivations by reconstructing views of data In a traditional approach, banks are entirely reliant on the current state of an object. For example, a customer’s current account balance. With an event driven architecture, we can reconstruct and view the series of transactions that led to a particular balance, or any other series of sophisticated interactions that lead to a current customer’s state. This is incredibly useful for optimising end user experience in customer apps, or in rapidly detecting potentially fraudulent transactions.Tools and third-party integrations","{""questions"": [""What are events?"", ""What are the benefits of an event-driven architecture?"", ""What are the drawbacks of an event-driven architecture?""]}"
15,,"Understanding the landscape Releases of the ecommerce monolith had many interconnected challenges:  Environments for integration testing, release testing, and production were manually provisioned. There was little visibility of what was running in each environment. Different teams ran different tests in different environments. Deployments were slow, and sometimes unstable. With a six month budget and a release every 21 days, we had a scheduled maximum of eight releases in which to make changes.  We started by collecting and visualising actionable data. Creating a dynamic catalogue of monolith versions and environments, we clarified the path to live and provided a real-time view of what was running where. After that, we visualised lead time (time from code to deployment) versus interval (time between deployments) for prior monolith releases. This gave us a clear picture. As the lead time showed build, test, and deploy activities required 14 days, this told us the product delivery bottleneck on weekly releases was in there.  We looked closely at the release testing activity, and confirmed it was a bottleneck. Each ecommerce monolith version incurred multiple release testing delays. The major factors were middleware downtime on deployment, and brittle end-to-end test scenarios. We estimated at least three months of work would bring release testing time down to a few hours. As testing wasn’t a bottleneck on fortnightly releases, we recommended moving from 21 day to 14 days as a stepping stone to success. However, when we collaborated with the operations team on a release plan, we discovered there was a second bottleneck in skills liquidity. As the release manager worked alone on callout rota coordination, release note validation, and change management for each release, the operations team would only be able to agree fortnightly releases, if we could reduce the release manager’s workload.Removing the bottleneck Focussing exclusively on the release management bottleneck for fortnightly releases, first, we replaced callout rota emails with a central rota owned by the development teams. This provided immediate success. In under a day, we eliminated countless emails and toil for the release manager. Next, we automated the release note workflow. Just two weeks building a release note generator in Python produced a single release note for all development and operations teams working on the ecommerce monolith. This replaced four different teams manually producing three separate release notes. Again, the release manager reported a noticeable reduction in their workload. Finally, we found another team member to share release planning work, alongside the release manager, then ran a single fortnightly release R20 as an experiment. No new errors were found. This was when we agreed with the operations team to permanently run the ecommerce monolith on fortnightly releases from R32 onwards. An updated visualisation showed build, test, and deploy activities remained at 14 days as expected. The interval had been successfully lowered to 14 days, eliminating the bottleneck on fortnightly releases within three months.A stepping stone to a digital future The technology stack for the ecommerce monolith and its on-premise environments was extremely complex. Moving to fortnightly releases in three months made a big difference to John Lewis & Partners. Our product manager was delighted when the product revenue uptick from fortnightly releases was higher than expected. As a result, they decided not to invest another three months of effort in the release testing bottleneck for weekly releases. This saved John Lewis & Partners £230K in budgeted team costs, and allowed team members to join the digital transformation programme earlier than expected. Moving the ecommerce monolith to fortnightly releases resulted in faster customer feedback, increased product revenues for John Lewis & Partners, and boosted early efforts on the John Lewis & Partners Digital Platform.","{""questions"": [""What is the main challenge for the ecommerce monolith?"", ""What is the main bottleneck for the ecommerce monolith?"", ""What is the main reason for the bottleneck?"", ""What is the solution to the bottleneck?""]}"
16,Communicating a changing structure and IT culture in an organisation,"Communicating a changing structure and IT culture in an organisation The digital team was undertaking a rapid delivery transformation. Working with Equal Experts they started to establish a whole new set of team structures, built a ‘you build it, you run it’ culture, and a major shift in their way of working. This has helped to change the workplace culture within the digital teams. But, for this programme of change to be a success, the benefits of rapid delivery needed to be communicated to the wider organisation. People outside of the digital teams needed to collaborate across the business without hesitation, to ensure there were no silos, only open and transparent work practices. To ensure this new way of working was accepted and adopted, in a still largely traditional IT environment, Equal Experts needed to communicate the value of the new software and working practices. This meant building a shared understanding and full appreciation of the agility with which teams can operate across all the operational groups. If we did this effectively, then we would position their organisation as an aspiring place to work and much admired by the technology, digital, and utilities sectors.Defining the messages, to ensure they resonate The first priority was to help them to find the right narrative for talking about rapid delivery, ensuring links to the strategic goals and organisational priorities were obvious. This would help everyone at the organisation to build confidence in their team’s capabilities, and create the foundations needed to be a ‘digital first’ water company. It was also important that the value, both financial and operational, was communicated. Finally, messaging needed to communicate clear leadership and vision, explain the internal culture change, and create a shifting perception of what is now possible. To achieve this, two key audiences were defined – internal and external. The Internal audience included the digital product and data factory teams, future digital product team members, operations teams, and customer experience teams. Here we needed to communicate how the new rapid delivery model and agile ways of working would help the whole organisation to meet its strategic aims. Externally the work needed to target digital and technology industry experts, future employees, and the wider utilities industry, particularly those working in digital or at the executive level. This needed to position the organisation as a “digital-first” organisation, with innovation at the heart of everything they do.A channel strategy to stimulate new thinking and lay foundations for innovation This was not something that could be communicated through a single channel, so a range of tactics was agreed. To promote transparency, openness and understanding throughout the organisation, there was a new dashboard, blog, and digital product showcase events. To demonstrate the effectiveness and value of the work – and improve their reputation with an internal and external audience, we created a range of supporting case studies and entered several high-profile industry awards. This highly successful strategy saw their success in the UKIT Awards, UK App Awards, DevOps Industry Awards, and TechWomen100 Awards. We also supported recruitment and built their reputation by amplifying the voices of individuals through leadership. This included public speaking, social media, and publicising the awards entries with relatable and accessible content. We also brought together a team of digital product experts for a panel discussion on how to be an effective product owner. It was an opportunity for employees to hear how other organisations have embedded product owners into their way of working.Taking a utilities company to the next level These initiatives combined, have started to build a radical new way of delivering IT solutions for the utilities sector. The cultural changes emerging with the project are helping the company move away from a bureaucratic governance model. Importantly, digital changes are now starting to be recognised and the team is working to ensure these are welcomed by everybody across the organisation rather than resisted. A good barometer of this is, increasingly, operational groups are enquiring about when their process can be digitised. An ‘I want some of that too’ culture.","{""questions"": [""What is the main goal of the digital team?"", ""What is the main goal of the organisation?"", ""What is the main goal of the digital team?"", ""What is the main goal of the organisation?"", ""What is the main goal of the digital team?"", ""What is the main goal of the organisation?""]}"
17,,"Understanding how to double deployments   Our client’s leadership team wanted to speed up product features and reduce error rates for their customers. The answer was to move the platform from monthly to fortnightly deployments. While some of the technology challenges needed to achieve this were well-understood, it wasn’t clear in what order they should be tackled. The product delivery bottleneck wasn’t obvious. To get a clearer picture, we collected deployment data, and visualised lead time (time from code to deployment) versus interval (time between deployments). The lead time showed build, test, and deploy activities always happened in under 14 days. The interval revealed planning and development took one to two months, which told us the product delivery bottleneck was in there. Through in-depth interviews with platform team members, we learned that deployments were scheduled months in advance, in lockstep with hardware launch dates. This meant each version was a large batch of new features and could go no faster than peripheral launches. Now we had identified planning lockstep as the product delivery bottleneck, we needed to demonstrate how removing it would unlock other improvements in the deployment pipeline. To accelerate deployment and ensure features could be enabled on the right date, we recommended the use of feature toggles. We then worked with the relevant teams to visualise GitLab CI metrics in Grafana dashboards. This provides an automated monitoring solution for speed of deployments, builds, and code across all software services in the organisation.Mapping out a plan for improvement   Next, we needed to plan a prioritised roadmap of improvement efforts. The platform teams were included in the creation of the improvement roadmap from the outset. This gave the leadership team confidence that there was buy-in for inserting a raft of improvement efforts into the product roadmap. Inspecting all aspects of feature development, we considered the entire feature lifecycle. This led us to an emphasis on ways of working. We advocated experimenting with work in progress limits, designing smaller feature definitions, and pairing during code reviews. To reduce error rates and their impact on customers, we also looked at technology changes in the platform itself. This could be done by incrementally migrating the frontend to TypeScript, and creating a canary beta channel for faster customer feedback on errors.Refining the Continuous Delivery strategy Before our arrival, the client had drafted a preliminary Continuous Delivery strategy. There was a focus on accelerating developer feedback loops, by speeding up the build system and the automated tests. This preliminary strategy needed to be pressure tested, using our previous experiences of Continuous Delivery. The platform build system was already being migrated from a data centre to AWS. Working with the platform teams to achieve earlier payoffs, we pinpointed which tasks to pull forward in the migration plan. This included decreasing network latency by consolidating AWS regions, and reducing compilation times by replacing Git submodules with internal libraries. Another area for improvement was automated testing cycles. These were complicated by the hundreds of different peripherals supported by the platform. By examining the USB bridge connector to the customer’s device lab, and where different types of testing occurred in the deployment pipeline, we outlined how to create a device simulator for peripherals, and how to re-sequence device lab testing. This would allow developers to receive feedback in minutes, rather than hours. As a result of this refinement and recommendations, our client is now in a strong position to achieve a step-change in how its software services are built, tested, and deployed to customers.","{""questions"": [""What is the product delivery bottleneck?"", ""What is the solution to the product delivery bottleneck?"", ""What is the solution to the product delivery bottleneck?""]}"
18,,"Removing financial barriers for sellers ListSure is a small organisation with a national footprint and limited office space. As such, it chooses to work in a ‘remote-first’ way. The Australian business approached Equal Experts to become its primary technology partner, to help modernise and accelerate its technology platform, and to achieve business goals of removing the financial barriers for sellers. Equal Experts had to take over from an existing supplier without losing continuity in service, while using team members in different locations, including ListSure’s team in Sydney, a technical/delivery team in Melbourne, and developers in Bangalore, India.Ensuring consistency and continuity – with zero disruption for customers The first part of the process was to do all of the introductions. These were conducted using video conference calls. All team members were made aware of the broader business context and environment, and not just the technical aspects. ListSure’s CEO, Brad Melman, walked through all aspects of the business, allowing ample Q&A time for the team. The next part of the process was to get a technical transfer of knowledge from the incumbent consultancy. This happened during several remote whiteboard sessions, with focused conversations. Meanwhile, time was invested in pairing a developer at the incumbent consultancy with the Equal Experts developers in Bangalore using screen-sharing tools and Zoom. This was to ensure everyone had the appropriate understanding to start developing and delivering software for ListSure. At the same time, the Melbourne-based lead was frequently in touch with the ListSure team members through video conferencing to understand the company’s business model and strategic direction. This ensured that the architectural and business directions were aligned. The day of the transition saw team members across the globe migrate systems, configurations, and user accounts and test the end-to-end deployment to production. All of this happened with no impact to the ListSure business or its customers.Remotely reducing release cycles from months, to weeks, to days ListSure was moving from traditional, sizeable six months or more release cycles to iterative two-week releases – and Equal Experts had a short-term goal of being able to release technology on a daily basis. This was possible because they adopted a You Build It You Run It approach throughout. The appropriate meetings were established right from the start, with co-ordinated time zones, and team members chose the necessary cloud-based tools. Daily video stand-ups while using a shared Jira board were also helpful. Working remotely from the start meant that it was commonplace to video call (even before the pandemic). The video calls allowed for sharing screens so that a particular issue could be shown and described visually, not just in words via phone calls or emails. This only-very-slightly different way of working, became the norm and worked effectively.","{""questions"": [""What are the benefits of working remotely?"", ""What are the challenges of working remotely?"", ""What are the benefits of working remotely?"", ""What are the challenges of working remotely?""]}"
19,,"Scaling up, scaling fast. Since launch, the underlying architecture and engineering has allowed the platform to rapidly scale, meaning that all merchants have been successfully migrated onto the gateway.  But with the gateway in a steady state, no one rested on their laurels – instead the knowledge and capability gained during the payment gateway project has been used to explore other opportunities in the digital payment solution space. A dynamic digital wallet that empowers customers. For the past year, the team have been looking into QR payments and other ways to create a more dynamic, digital wallet (similar to other P2M (Person to Merchant) offerings such as Google Pay or Apple Pay).  From there, the client has taken the next step into P2P (person to person) transactions, and they are now actively exploring how to sell these propositions to financial institutions as well as mobile network operators.  The key aspect baked into every aspect of the offering is flexibility – customers can configure the platform, mix and match propositions, create new combinations, choose how to pay.  The power is in making customers powerful.Succeeding in the age of Covid. Despite the impacts of Covid, especially the disruption to the previously co-located teams, the work has gone from strength to strength.  Indeed, the two companies have evolved their working relationship into new and exciting territory, as demonstrated by Equal Experts’ involvement in a new project which involves a mixed team of stakeholders interrogating new ideas, and substantiating the best of them with a business case – answering such questions as: does the idea have good market fit, how much revenue would we hope to make year one, how much would it cost to launch, and how long would it take? In this way, expertise and domain knowledge can be shared during the entire decision-making process, to tackle the ‘why’ – not just the ‘what’ and the ‘how’.  Now questions are asked earlier, assumptions are exposed and (dis)proved, solutions proposed and experiments designed.","{""questions"": [""What is the name of the company?"", ""What is the name of the product?"", ""What is the name of the project?"", ""What is the name of the new project?"", ""What is the name of the new product?""]}"
20,,"Day 1: A strategy defined Working remotely due to coronavirus restrictions, the Chiesi executive team met via a Zoom session and virtual whiteboard, facilitated by two Equal Experts Strategic Advisors. The intent: to take Chiesi to the next level by embracing the opportunities and challenges of the digital world. By the end of what proved to be an extremely collaborative and productive day, the team had established and agreed on their five long term goals. Aligned with these goals, nineteen significant outcomes had been identified, and the associated measures of success defined. We visualised the outcomes using our proprietary tool, the Roadmap Radar.Day 2: Turning strategy into action Now that the framework was in place, the team focused on the immediate practical actions that could be undertaken for each outcome, and by lunchtime a wealth of realisable ideas were on the board. In the afternoon, another of our tools, the Bet Canvas, was used to turn the first two candidate ideas into actionable initiatives, and the participants were in a position to form teams and move to delivery.Exceeding expectations The executive team set out to identify up to five impactful ideas that could be pursued with immediate effect. What they produced was a rich strategy, a framework for reshaping the delivery organisation, nineteen viable ideas and a shortlist of eight on which to focus first. As facilitators, we observed that the primary reasons for this success were the clearly collaborative culture within the executive team and the high level of belief in the organisation’s mission and values. Don’t just take our word for it; here’s what Dave Barnes, Technical Director & QP at Chiesi had to say: “When we wanted to start our digital journey, we needed some support to get off the starting blocks. With lots of ideas, but struggling to find focus, Equal Experts were able to help us visualise our goals and start to add some structure to our plan and help formulate a strategy. As if this challenge wasn’t hard enough, we chose to hold our two day workshop virtually from our homes due to the COVID lockdown. Helping us to get our ideas onto paper ( actually an interactive cloud based whiteboard!) the team at Equal Experts were able to show us some excellent tools to help us prioritise them and shape them into a strategy.

21,,"Continuous Delivery, and how to keep the highest standards of compliance. When it comes to regulation, partial compliance is the same as no compliance. This created interesting Security challenges when it came to Continuous Delivery. How could we achieve compliance whilst continuously delivering outcomes within tight timescales? The Qualified Security Assessor (or QSA) audit required evidence of compliance to gain certification. Often, this can be as simple as providing a screenshot of a one-off manual process. At all times, the team considered the value of quick and inexpensive compliance compared to the longer-term value of automation. In the near term, they took a hybrid approach – automating where they could and working manually to demonstrate compliance in other areas. This highly pragmatic approach was taken to help launch against very aggressive timescales. Post-launch, everything was automated, thereby enabling rapid, unlimited scalability downstream.Engaging early, often, and throughout, to work within the regulations. Constraints, such as regulatory requirements, can be frustrating. But viewed from another perspective, they can end up being immensely valuable to delivery teams. Unambiguously specified detail about compliance is not up for debate or interpretation. Adherence to the regulations was measured and ultimately certified, by a QSA. As one of the principles of Continuous Delivery is to engage early, often, and throughout the process we worked closely with the QSA from the very beginning of the engagement. This helped the QSA understand how the requirements were being met in an unfamiliar way – in this case, agile delivery in the cloud. At that time, our client approached compliance by tracking releases through tickets. The team challenged the process. They recognised that instead of raising a ticket for every piece of work, the regulatory mandates could be met by tracking progress in Git. The QSA confirmed that the new approach would work.Effectively convincing stakeholders about new ways of working. Dry run compliance exercises were run throughout the project. This ensured the team was on the right trajectory towards complete PCI compliance. The QSA’s experience was of more traditional ways of working and needed this time to build up sufficient context and confidence. This iterative, joined-up approach offered everyone a chance to challenge and educate the QSA and each other on the principles of modern software delivery. One example is: when it came to intrusion detection/prevention, the client had a variety of options, such as buying a product off the shelf. But there are many ways to detect intrusions. In the cloud, there were various native components that could be used, with which the auditor was unfamiliar. The team explored common scenarios to address the concerns of the QSA and other unconvinced stakeholders, by showing how security objectives could be met without spending the client’s money on unnecessary products. The alternatives showed how they could build solutions themselves by leveraging cloud-native applications that were as good, if not better, than the traditional on-premise solutions. At the same time, the team was comparing the value of the client’s traditional approach, which was to buy commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) products, to building solutions using cloud-native applications. The advantage of COTS is that they guarantee compliance; the disadvantages include:  The products seldom being designed for cloud-native use cases Non-ownership of the solution The risk of being tied into potentially expensive, long-term contracts The fact that it is easy to lose sight of the security threat you are trying to defend against  To proceed in a new direction required a mental shift, so to make the best decision with the greatest buy-in the team ran a series of quick proofs of concept, to evaluate the difference between the current decision-making mindset and the proposed new approach.How to ensure Continuous Delivery = Continuous Compliance. It was vital to continuously comply with the regulatory checkpoints. With Continuous Delivery minimising the time to Production, to remain efficient and effective security and testing had to be embedded into the pipeline. Specific tests were run to ensure compliance with specific regulatory requirements, and what’s more, a full and transparent audit trail had to be maintained. This was achieved through documenting what they were releasing and why they were doing it, and, encapsulated in JIRA tickets then linked and stored in Git to provide a single, and fully traceable, source of truth. For Continuous Delivery a key metric is time to production. To avoid an emphasis on velocity causing a proliferation of bugs, the team relied on feature flags. The aim was to ensure new features didn’t break the old ones, and this was achieved by integrating testing and spinning up parallel testing threads to radically reduce the total test time to mere minutes. As the team delivered more features, more tests were added, until they numbered in the many thousands. That introduced a lag between the test being run and the results. By revisiting the architecture of the tests, the team worked hard to minimise the testing time, whilst continuing to provide confidence and reassurance to the business. When continuously releasing code, it is a reliable measure to say that if the team estimates the work will take more than a week, then the change is so large the work needs to be broken down into smaller deliverable units of functionality.The step-by-step approach to creating more productive Release Governance. In the past, decisions on releases were complicated, involving multiple sign-offs, with decisions typically taking weeks. When the issue reached the Change Advisory Board (CAB), it was discussed by a large group, and only if it was unanimously agreed could a ticket be raised. After that, further delays were expected as the ticket was in a queue to be approved and the code released. Many unnecessary hours were consumed at the expense of more productive work. Creating the optimal Governance process was both important and a challenge. At the beginning of the engagement, there was a call with the CAB every week, but over time the frequency dropped to monthly calls. Together with the client we worked on transitioning from a largely uninvolved committee of senior stakeholders making decisions, to devolving the authority to approve work to those with the most informed perspective. This ensured the team operated within PCI whilst maintaining the ability to release hundreds of times per year. The aim became how to best communicate the progress of the work, thereby giving confidence to the stakeholders using evidence – e.g. this feature was released on time, within budget, and fully compliant without creating bugs or causing production downtime.","{""questions"": [""What are the benefits of Continuous Delivery?"", ""What are the challenges of Continuous Delivery?"", ""What are the benefits of Continuous Compliance?"", ""What are the challenges of Continuous Compliance?"", ""What are the benefits of Continuous Delivery and Continuous Compliance?"", ""What are the challenges of Continuous Delivery and Continuous Compliance?""]}"
22,,"How a world of knowledge helped to launch Australia’s first neobank. Xinja was in their early start-up phase, and they had limited in-house technological expertise. They needed access to a high standard of expertise that could deliver at pace. Qualities they recognised in Equal Experts (before the office in Australia). Equal Experts was responsible for the design, development, and delivery of the Xinja App and platform, all of which was completed “Remote First” by Xinja and Equal Experts team members working from different locations around the world.Understanding deeply – through discovery and inception.   Starting with a small team, we spent time getting to know Xinja and understand their goals. Inception workshops with various leaders of the business, IT, marketing, product strategy, and customer service team clarified the business context. The goal was to get a holistic view of Xinja’s direction, the time frames they aimed for, and their measures of success. Using online “Opportunity Canvases” and user journey maps, we were able to derive the business context and identify the areas which needed further research. This was done by holding focused workshops over video calls. The results ensured that all team members were aware of the broader business context and environment and not just the technical aspects.How we successfully (and remotely) developed, tested, and delivered a product in six months. Throughout the build, weekly backlog refinement sessions were held over video calls with the client. Equal Experts produced end-of-sprint showcases (including demos) to the entire Xinja team, which gave them the ability to provide feedback on any area of the delivery. This, in turn, gave Xinja a full breakdown of what was agreed in the sprint (both committed and stretch goals), and their traffic light status detailing anything affecting velocity, blockers, or anything needing further qualification from Xinja. This was also the time used to give visibility of what would be brought into the next sprint and highlight any dependencies that we would need Xinja to help us unblock for future sprints.  Online collaborative tools such as Jira and Confluence, Google Suite, and Miro were used to define the features and stories needed. Every story was refined via video conference using collaborative tools before actual development and testing could take place. This meant that Jira became even more critical as a source of truth, but it gave the benefit of providing stakeholders with a full and transparent view of the current state of the project at all times. We used communication tools such as Slack to keep in contact with each other, and screen shared pairing tools to allow our developers to pair programme. We also had development Logging and monitoring tools that could be accessed by the team, anywhere in the world, giving a single point in time view of development activities and operability of the system.","{""questions"": [""What is the name of the company that helped to launch Australias first neobank?"", ""What is the name of the companys product?"", ""What is the name of the companys product?""]}"
23,,"Providing a rapid response – and a brand new service. The coronavirus pandemic resulted in thousands of concerned Irish citizens calling the Health Service Executive (HSE), the body responsible for the provision of health and personal social services for everyone living in Ireland. They wanted to ask for advice on their symptoms. Caredoc’s clinicians were tasked with triaging these calls, then phoning back citizens with suspected COVID-19 symptoms, further evaluating condition and considering their next steps. This was a brand-new service, rapidly put in place in response to the escalating pandemic. There were no supporting systems in place.A production-ready system in just 24 hours. Caredoc needed to be certain that they had followed up on every incoming call, and that the outcome of each call was logged and reported. However, without a supporting IT system this became a significant administrative burden. Recognising the need for an internal system where call handlers could log incoming calls, allocate them to clinicians to follow up, and ensure that all calls and outcomes were tracked and monitored, they contacted UX Forms. In just 24 hours, a single consultant had built a production-ready system, complete with shareable call logs, access control, automated notification emails, and two dedicated forms – one for the initial call handlers and the other for clinician follow ups. The next day the service was used in production, and over the following days UX Forms worked closely with Caredoc to evolve the solution – as the steps required in the service were changing rapidly.Immediately saving clinicians two hours a day. By implementing the digital service in UX Forms, Caredoc effectively eliminated manual admin and reconciliation tasks to track calls, and enabled patients’ calls to be resolved more quickly than before. Within minutes they had made a number of adjustments to reflect changes in clinical pathways and subsequent form changes were completed quickly and effectively. “We moved from a slow laborious paper-based system, to a quick and efficient digital system,” said Michelle Kearns, CIO at Caredoc.About UX Forms.

24,,"Working around a substandard management system. Staff rotas – and the decisions and processes used to devise them – are an emotive topic. They directly affect lives and, when not done correctly, put a strain on colleague/manager relationships. The Co-op’s food retail business had new, revamped stores that provided a more welcoming experience for shoppers. However, behind the scenes, coordination of their staff and rotas was a much less user-friendly experience. Their IT system used to manage rotas was difficult to use, and only accessible by managers. This left stores relying on a paper-based system to manage shifts for over 45,000 employees. A cumbersome process, it involved staff printing the rota, taking a photo and then sharing it in WhatsApp groups. This resulted in staff being unsure whether information was the most up-to-date, and there was little consistency from store to store. As a result, shift confusion was a common complaint of those leaving the business.It all started with understanding how staff interacted with technology. After evaluating a number of off-the-shelf products, Co-op quickly realised these would be extremely invasive and expensive to implement. Realising the potential to work by plugging the gaps in the current system, Co-op asked us to create a solution that could easily be accessed by all staff. Through user research, Co-op identified that many staff didn’t use a personal email address, but smartphone use was prevalent. Therefore a web-app would provide the lowest possible barrier to use. Named ‘Shifts’, it needed to be simple to use and accessible to Co-op staff of all ages and digital capabilities. Offering a brand-new front end to a complex existing system, the app used an API to access all data, which made it easy to understand and interact with on a mobile device.How a single app can transform culture and relationships across an organisation.   Before Shifts, any colleague with doubts about their payslip had to rely completely on their manager’s word. Colleagues could raise queries with managers, who could check and report back, but colleagues were always one step removed from the data. Now, everything is transparent. Every user can see exactly when they punched in and out, as well as a weekly summary of scheduled hours. Shifts also allows for different levels of access. When in ‘Manager View’ it assembles information alongside relevant calls-to-action, including team holiday requests. Previously, this information was only accessible through a desktop computer, and there was only one per store, usually in the back office. With Shifts, these processes take moments – and can be completed on the shop floor, freeing up valuable time for the manager to improve customer service.Creating better partnerships through collaboration and partnership.   Shifts is an enterprise-scale collaboration with real users benefits. Co-op Digital (Co-op Group’s IT division) worked with Co-op Food (customer and product owner) to deliver the project vision. Equal Experts then brought this vision to life, by rebuilding the alpha from the ground up to provide Shifts as a live service, ready for rollout to thousands of users. As it stands, the resulting service is still optional and requires colleagues to use their own mobile device and data, but they clearly feel it’s worth it. Five months after its nationwide rollout, the app is used in every one of the UK’s 2,600 Co-op Food Stores. 80% of store colleagues and 95% of store managers already depend on Shifts, which has become vital to store operation. In addition, managers regularly report improved attendance and colleagues’ feedback that they appreciate the added control they have with Shifts.","{""questions"": [""What is the name of the app?"", ""What is the purpose of the app?"", ""What is the name of the company that created the app?"", ""What is the name of the company that created the app?"", ""What is the name of the company that created the app?""]}"
25,,"Gaining in-depth insights for unrivalled clarity Consultants from Equal Experts joined the team at Hermes, working closely with a number of suppliers as well as Hermes’ own people. This helped us gain a greater understanding of the business and all its intricacies. By working with stakeholders across the organisation from customer services, sales and marketing, to clients and those Hermes deliver to, we gained a comprehensive picture of the challenges they faced. We discovered that the organisation needed to:  Stay competitive by cutting costs (for instance, by reducing avoidable calls to the call centre). Improve the user experience for their clients and the parcel recipient.  Hermes’ goals demanded a completely new approach to their technology. As the business became more complex, the historical platform was slowing down. The role of Equal Experts was to work with Hermes to design and build an entirely new one.A single, robust platform delivers agility for an evolving future The new system was based on an API-first platform. It allowed Hermes to consolidate multiple online experiences into a single, more user-friendly service. Some front-end services, like the Hermes app, fell outside our direct remit, but still needed the APIs we set up to operate. The platform was the very keystone of the organisation’s ongoing mobile and web development strategy. It enabled clients and parcel recipients to engage better with Hermes, who found offering improved services was now easier than ever. As a result, clients could be onboarded more quickly, and the flexibility provided more support as their needs grew and changed.Devising a roadmap for market leading goals and providing the support to achieve them   Equal Experts also led the Programme Analysis. Our team helped create a roadmap to guide Hermes’ technology suppliers, setting out its direction and identifying priorities. This also helped us clarify the MVP delivery, which we brought forward, ensuring Hermes could benefit from its investment even sooner than expected. Our wide range of experience also helped ensure different suppliers worked together as a unified delivery team. Working closely with them gave us the opportunity to embed new working practices. Now, teams start small and evolve, keeping the focus on continually adding value. This ongoing transformation is already delivering benefits. New business is being won, existing clients have been retained, and Hermes is in a prime position to achieve its goals. Even better, the Hermes team won Digital Team of The Year in the Digital Technology Leaders Awards 2018. We are proud to have been part of this ambitious transformation project and look forward to seeing where Hermes is going next.","{""questions"": [""What is the role of Equal Experts?"", ""What is the new system based on?"", ""What is the keystone of the organisations ongoing mobile and web development strategy?""]}"
26,,"Understanding the business needs of a large organisation, technical needs of a startup, and bridging the gap between them. Mendeley’s free-to-use reference manager and academic social network allow users to easily manage their research, connect and collaborate with more than five million researchers worldwide. It serves customers via three platforms: desktop, web and mobile – with apps for both iOS and Android. Following the acquisition by Elsevier in 2013, Mendeley found itself experiencing challenges. These were the kinds of challenges that can be expected by a company transitioning from a start-up to a more established business – and they are all accompanied by an increased degree of complexity and inconsistency of data. Mendeley approached Equal Experts to identify any organisational problems that existed – and to propose solutions. This included:  Investigating assumptions around the (perceived) status quo of the current Mendeley infrastructure and codebase. Production of technical diagrams and documentation to show the actual current state. Presenting recommendations that would enable Mendeley to move forwards more efficiently and effectively.Effectively gathering data – or how ‘brain dumps’ light the way. To begin we conducted interviews with staff across all of Mendeley’s technological areas. These conversations, or ‘brain dumps,’ allowed Equal Experts to gather together a complete knowledge of Mendeley’s technical landscape, offering a view of all current projects, their purposes, tools and processes being used, issues and successes as well as any associated code repositories. This analysis highlighted an unnecessarily high level of customisation and use of niche tools, a lack of governance around whether products were fit for purpose, the ‘definition of done,’ and products being driven by developers , with no accountability or control, rather than by customer need. A list of observations was drawn up, including the following:  Make technology more visible, with the product/team backlogs covering all work that that team has to deliver together. Prioritise the decommissioning of legacy systems, to remove delivery uncertainty surrounding new initiatives, projects, features and bug fixing. The time/cost of delivery is hard to define when a dependency on a legacy system is identified. Simplify and stabilise the deployment pipeline. Continuous deployment is a great goal to aim for, but it shouldn’t come at the cost of a loss in productivity, or the ability to change. Adopt a consistent approach to similar problems. While we support team autonomy, working in total isolation is undesirable.A clear path for better future decision making. This was not a software delivery project. Instead Equal Experts used expertise in technology and process to solve a different type of business problem. Before, Mendeley had an incomplete view of its overall digital architecture. Now, it has a complete understanding. This means the business can make better decisions about technology choices now and in the future.","{""questions"": [""What are the three platforms Mendeley serves customers via?"", ""What are the challenges Mendeley experienced following the acquisition by Elsevier?"", ""What are the recommendations that would enable Mendeley to move forwards more efficiently and effectively?""]}"
27,,"A sensitive approach to the problem Before Equal Experts, the process of arranging funerals was carried out through manual administration. Staff needed to fill in over 20 paper forms for every funeral, and deal with several software systems. Over time, different regions and branches had adopted their own manual approaches too. Creating a joined-up approach was essential. Our initial aims were clear: “A simple, thoughtful funeral arrangement service that lets our staff spend more time face to face with clients, and less time filling in paper forms.” This meant creating a service which supports a variety of activities including handling calls, arranging service, booking a hearse, and allocating staff.Putting users front and centre Equal Experts took time to understand Co-op’s processes, pain points and goals. These were distilled into a set of user needs and the team began to sketch out the beginnings of the digital service – a ‘thin slice’ of end-to-end functionality. From the beginning, we knew that a user-friendly and intuitive interface would be essential. We could not assume a high level of computer literacy for our users, nor did we want to create the need for weeks of training.40 Co-op staff were involved in testing this alpha service. This meant they could try out vital services like tracking the details of the first customer calls, view a ‘mortuary dashboard,’ arrange funerals via a shared calendar, and manage inventory and logistics. Over 150 scenarios were tested by real-life users, giving us invaluable feedback and the confidence to move into the beta stage.Seamless new ways of working The Co-op Digital Team saw the project as an opportunity to demonstrate new ways of working to the Funeralcare business. Starting with rapid one-week sprints, we adapted our methods over time. These initial sprints helped us to show our vision to key stakeholders. We then moved to two-week sprints, easing pressure, and allowing stakeholders to see the evolution of features. Following this, we moved to a Kanban approach – high priority feedback was received from live trials, meaning we could move quickly, and with minimal disruption. The whole project involved some of the most cutting-edge innovation – from the end-to-end deployment of whole environment sacks, to an overnight tear-down and rebuild. Working closely with Co-op’s existing infrastructure, and ensuring that we only built features that were genuinely required, meant colleagues were onboard and ready to take ownership of the new service.High hopes for roll-out The project was a success, and roll-out across all Funeralcare homes began in 2017. Colleagues have been able to manage their workloads more effectively, meaning they are able to provide that crucial support to customers during a time of need – and Co-op Funeralcare have reported £3 million in annual savings as a result. What’s more, with Equal Experts, Co-op Funeralcare has been able to demonstrate a new, innovative way of doing things which sets a high bar for the entire funeral industry.","{""questions"": [""What are the aims of Equal Experts?"", ""What are the user needs of Equal Experts?"", ""What is the user-friendly and intuitive interface of Equal Experts?"", ""What is the feedback of Equal Experts?"", ""What is the success of Equal Experts?""]}"
28,,"Difficult to manage data. Informa’s Agribusiness Intelligence division covers agricultural industries and provides in-depth data and insight to customers – helping them to make more strategic, and better-informed decisions. After a number of mergers and acquisitions, and the integration of new brands, it became increasingly difficult to manage data efficiently. Various legacy processes were also creating inconsistency and duplication. Reports were also an issue. Supplied to customers in an outdated PDF format, they required a huge amount of manual work, especially as they could run to many hundreds of pages. Agribusiness Intelligence saw an opportunity to address its own processes to better manage, access and use its valuable data, and improve the end products to customers.Making data more valuable – through restructuring and consistency. Informa asked Equal Experts to help them organise thousands of disparate data items into a new digital platform, accessed via a new customer portal, known as IEG Vantage. Starting with an initial two-week inception, Equal Experts examined more than 40 years worth of Informa data, products and deliverables. It quickly became apparent that it was impossible to bring everything online in 6 months. Instead we needed to focus on delivering the best possible value, by focusing efforts on the part of the business which had the most revenue at risk. Once this was decided, we started delivering usable content in an online format, validating with customers as we worked. By restructuring the source data, which was spread across thousands of spreadsheets, we could post to the new platform in a consistent manner. This also helped transform the customer experience, making it easier to search and filter sets of data, and access more digestible custom charts and tables.Saving time through automated delivery. Now came the real innovation. The Informa team was now able to automate the ingestion of data into the new platform, including the creation of metadata to describe different information points. This meant a mammoth migration task became achievable. It also allowed ingested data, which had previously been far less accessible, to be found and used more effectively. This data was now directly at the customers’ fingertips, providing IEG Vantage customers with detailed, tailored business reports. Enormous and unwieldy PDF reports (some of which extended to 3,000 pages), are now a thing of the past, with a new customer portal offering a much more dynamic service. By featuring the latest market updates, downloads, and interactive charts, they make full use of the breadth of data held by Informa.Unlocking the full potential of data, and increasing customer satisfaction. For the first time, Agribusiness Intelligence’s insight has unlocked the full potential for its IEG Vantage customers. The enhanced customer experience has seen the declining trend in subscription renewals reversed. In fact, the division has seen higher subscription renewal rates than at any other point in its history, with 12-month renewal rates approaching 90%. Weekly page views are up by over 130%, with ensuing data downloads up by over 700%. Customer feedback has been overwhelmingly positive, with Advanced Bioenergy declaring the platform and reports ‘1,000 times better than before’.","{""questions"": [""What is the name of the company?"", ""What is the name of the division?"", ""What is the name of the new customer portal?"", ""What is the name of the new platform?"", ""What is the name of the new division?""]}"
29,,"Understanding the complexities of buying and selling billboard space. For a media owner, it’s essential to make it as easy as possible for your customers to view pricing and placement options – and place an order. That sounds straightforward, but it’s not. Because the price of a product the customer is buying is based in real time when their quote was generated. The actual price is dependent on a large variety of factors, including availability, times and dates. In other words, Clear Channel’s inventory is priced on a programmatic basis. Transactions take place between the customer’s automated buying software, known as Demand-Side Platforms (DSPs), and Clear Channel’s own systems. Add in the wider context, that Clear Channel moved to a fully programmatic business model a while ago, which enables customers to plan, buy, optimise and measure the effectiveness of their campaigns, all within a single, simple, platform. All of a sudden, buying and selling billboard space had become a more complex undertaking.Addressing isolated systems – and allowing growth. Previously, Clear Channel relied on two separate systems to do business – an order management system (that does pretty much what you’d expect it to), and a campaign management system (to manage the ad creative that ends up filling the media space and its scheduling). But these systems existed in isolation, making it hard to synchronise orders with the details of the campaign concerned or to compute the precise cost of an order at the time a quote was requested. It also meant customers needed to contact Clear Channel to provide their specific campaign requirements and negotiate the quote based on those needs. These problems had to be addressed if the business was to scale, especially with the introduction of new digital screens and expansion into new regions.Engineering a smoother buying experience. Clear Channel asked Equal Experts to design and deliver an e-commerce portal that enables the company’s clients to browse products, check availability (and corresponding prices), and create, manage and cancel orders. This demanded a proprietary API to be written, allowing Clear Channel to make its systems available to more DSPs, and, in turn, making it easier for customers to buy products. A distributed team of 11 Equal Experts consultants joined forces with five Clear Channel employees to begin development on the solution. The project began with a workshop, which produced a set of prioritised stories, distilled from the wider business requirements. The goal was to release the first version of the API, with minimum viable features, as soon as possible. It went live just six months later.A quick, nimble synchronisation. This swift delivery was achieved with the team adopting a simple one-week sprint cycle, embracing XP practices like TDD, Pair Programming, Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery. This ensured steady progress while maintaining high quality at all times and allowed client feedback to be looped back into the development process early and often. Business features have been decoupled and implemented via micro services (individually shipped as docker containers), with AWS being used for cloud infrastructure. Less than six months after commencing work, the project team achieved complete synchronisation between the two systems, creating a more user-friendly customer experience, and significantly enhancing Clear Channel’s programmatic offering.","{""questions"": [""What is the difference between Clear Channels old system and the new system?"", ""What is the difference between Clear Channels old system and the new system?"", ""What is the difference between Clear Channels old system and the new system?""]}"
30,,"Improving the customer experience of a megastar event in a short timescale. A series of concerts were planned at The O2 Arena to celebrate O2’s 10th birthday. These included Ed Sheeran, Alt-J, Jamiroquai and Foo Fighters.  O2 asked Equal Experts to integrate Priority Tickets into their main Priority offering. The work should be designed to deal with the high anticipated ticket demand and introduce a more consistent, high-quality customer experience. There was just a couple of months to get the new system ready in time for the ticket pre-sale.Flexible working allowed everyone to achieve their target.   As part of our wider engagement with O2, Equal Experts had already started a major piece of work to replace the main Priority platform on a new AWS platform. It was clear the only hope of supporting the anticipated demand would be to find a way to use this new platform. Of course, what sounded a straightforward plan on paper was highly ambitious in practice, particularly within such a tight timeframe.  The hybrid solution was required to route customers via the new platform to get their tickets but still worked with the old platform to provide everything else. This would allow us to meet the deadline and provide a great experience for eager fans. It would also allow the team to move the remaining features to the new platform when the time was right.Integration, for a seamless customer experience.   Despite the hybrid approach to build, the user experience had to be seamless – at a time of extremely high demand. This required the iOS and Android apps and the Priority website to be updated within the same deadline.  When the digital doors were flung open, we had 40,000 superfans simultaneously flood into the new Priority Tickets service, and much like the artists themselves, it didn’t skip a beat.  The only complaint? Well, a grumble or two from those who were too late to snag a ticket.Once the initial project was successfully implemented – further improvements were swift (not Taylor).   The hybrid model was only ever a (successful) means to an end. With the initial goal complete, we immediately set out to complete the transition of legacy services to the new platform. We’ve now achieved this, enabling O2 to decommission the legacy platform. We’ve also continued to iterate upon the new platform, adding new functionality.  A key feature was the addition of third party access to the Priority Tickets content management system, adding the concept of roles and permissions to what was previously a non-hierarchical CMS. O2’s sponsorship partners now have a (limited) view of the Priority Tickets backend, allowing them to add 80% of all tickets to the platform directly.  It’s not all backend improvements; the customer experience has also been enhanced in multiple ways, including a tour-tracking feature that provides customers with more options to see their favourite stars live.","{""questions"": [""What is the main priority of the company?"", ""What is the main priority of the company?"", ""What is the main priority of the company?""]}"
